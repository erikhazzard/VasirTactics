# Ideas
---
* Turn based
* Each player gets N creatures (say, 3)

## Game is creature based
* Revolves around fighting creatures. Like a mini shining force
* After fighting a creature and defeating it, you gain ability to 'unlock' the creature

### Player abilities
* Players can unlock unlock abilities which will give them some boost
* Players can level up.  Matches take place between similar leveled players, but should balanced enough that a low level might have a chance
* Players can pick passive abilities like "all 'fire' creatures get +2 strength"
* Could pick active abilities like "Heal all creatures for N health"

## Creatures 
* Creatures are instaniated from some base creature object and attribtues overwritten based on player stats

## Initiating Games
* You can initiate a game with anyone by starting a game and providing them a link to play
    * E.g., connect via facebook or twitter and send link to friend
* Whoever clicks on the link first will become the next player
    * You could publically tweet the link, for instance, and whoever clicks first becomes the player
* If a player clicks on a link that someone else already clicked on, give them the option to start a new game

## Accounts
* Require account to play - can simply use twitter or facebook, and a game account wil be created for you
    * Or, should anonymous play be allowed?  Could use a link to return state?o
* You can play up to N games (say, 5) at a time per account.
* Each game is independant, not linked other games
